# user_feed

`user_feed` is an open source project &mdash; it's one among many other shared libraries that make up the wider ecosystem of software made and open sourced by `Savannah Informatics Limited`.

A shared library for `BeWell-Consumer` and `BeWell-Professional` that is responsible for rendering and refreshing user-feed and engagement.

## Installation Instructions

Use this package as a library by depending on it

Run this command:

- With Flutter:

```dart
$ flutter pub add user_feed
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

```dart
dependencies:
  user_feed: ^0.1.29-nullsafety
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Lastly:

Import it like so:

```dart
import 'package:user_feed/user_feed.dart';
```
